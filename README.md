# 18-789 CMU Deep Generative Models - Final Project - NYT Connections
Most large language models (LLMs) are trained to perform tasks related to classifying texts, answering questions, and translating text. Puzzle generation is a task that requires a high level of logical reasoning, understanding of intrinsic complexities of text and context, and a certain amount of creativity. Though there are many works centered on text generation and assessing creativity in large language models, only a few specifically focus on creative puzzle generation. We propose Connections Generator, a novel system that enables fully automated generation of unique, challenging puzzles resembling the New York Times Connections puzzle.
